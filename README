NuGridpy
========

MOST RECENT SVN REVISION STILL CONTAINING NUGRIDPY: r6619

NuGridPy has been migrated to this github repository from the svn
repository. All components present here have now been removed from
the svn. Please checkout r6619 if you would like access to the
most recent version in the svn prior to NuGridPy's removal.

Nugridpy is a set of Python tools to access and analyse (e.g. plot)
the various output formats (including the hdf5-based se format) from
NuGrid codes (mppnp and ppn) and from the MESA stellar evolution
code. In principle the NuGridpy tools can be used on any stellar
evolution code output if the tools to write se hdf5 files available on
the NuGrid web page are used.  The mesa.py module will work with MESA
ASCII output in the 'LOGS' directory. These modules were written with an
interactive work mode in mind, in particular taking advantage of the
interactive ipython session that we usually start with 'ipython
--pylab' or inside an ipython notebook.

Once your session starts import the mesa or nugridse or ppn module
(depending on which type of data you are working with):

>>> import mesa as ms

and read the docstring:

>>> help(ms)

There are reasonable doc strings in the modules. If you have made tested
and debugged improvements we are happy to know about them and we may
add them to the release available on the web page. The tools provided
here are useful to us, but of course there are still many things that
need attention and improvement.  We have a good list of scheduled
improvements, let us know if you want to help with these. You can
contact us by email: swjones@uvic.ca.
