Welcome to NUPYCEE documentation!
=====================================

The user can choose between the *Stellar Yields for galactic modeling applications* (SYGMA) module 
and the *One-zone model for the evolution of galaxies* (OMEGA) module.
SYGMA allows to follow the ejecta of of simple stellar populations in a closed box while OMEGA deals with
the simulation of galaxies with inflows and outflows.
Documentation for the stellar abundance library (STELLAB) is also available.
